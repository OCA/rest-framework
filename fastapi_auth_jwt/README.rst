This module provides ``FastAPI`` ``Depends`` to allow authentication
with
`auth_jwt <https://github.com/OCA/server-auth/tree/16.0/auth_jwt>`__.

Usage
=====

The following FastAPI dependencies are provided and importable from
``odoo.addons.fastapi_auth_jwt.dependencies``:

``def auth_jwt_authenticated_payload() -> Payload``

   Return the authenticated JWT payload. Raise a 401 (unauthorized) if
   absent or invalid.

``def auth_jwt_optionally_authenticated_payload() -> Payload | None``

   Return the authenticated JWT payload, or ``None`` if the
   ``Authorization`` header and cookie are absent. Raise a 401
   (unauthorized) if present and invalid.

``def auth_jwt_authenticated_partner() -> Partner``

   Obtain the authenticated partner corresponding to the provided JWT
   token, according to the partner strategy defined on the ``auth_jwt``
   validator. Raise a 401 (unauthorized) if the partner could not be
   determined for any reason.

   This is function suitable and intended to override
   ``odoo.addons.fastapi.dependencies.authenticated_partner_impl``.

   The partner record returned by this function is bound to an
   environment that uses the Odoo user obtained from the user strategy
   defined on the ``auth_jwt`` validator. When used
   ``authenticated_partner_impl`` this in turn ensures that
   ``odoo.addons.fastapi.dependencies.authenticated_partner_env`` is
   also bound to the correct Odoo user.

``def auth_jwt_optionally_authenticated_partner() -> Partner``

   Same as ``auth_jwt_partner`` except it returns an empty recordset
   bound to the ``public`` user if the ``Authorization`` header and
   cookie are absent, or if the JWT validator could not find the partner
   and declares that the partner is not required.

``def auth_jwt_authenticated_odoo_env() -> Environment``

   Return an Odoo environment using the the Odoo user obtained from the
   user strategy defined on the ``auth_jwt`` validator, if the request
   could be authenticated using a JWT validator. Raise a 401
   (unauthorized) otherwise.

   This is function suitable and intended to override
   ``odoo.addons.fastapi.dependencies.authenticated_odoo_env_impl``.

``def auth_jwt_default_validator_name() -> str | None``

   Return the name of the default JWT validator to use.

   The default implementation returns ``None`` meaning only one active
   JWT validator is allowed. This dependency is meant to be overridden.

``def auth_jwt_http_header_authorization() -> str | None``

   By default, return the credentials part of the ``Authorization``
   header, or ``None`` if absent. This dependency is meant to be
   overridden, in particular with
   ``fastapi.security.OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer`` to let swagger
   handle OAuth2 authorization (such override is only necessary for
   comfort when using the swagger interface).
