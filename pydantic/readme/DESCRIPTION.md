This addon provides a utility method that can be used to map odoo record
to a [Pydantic model](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).

If you need to make your Pydantic models extendable at runtime, takes a
look at the python package
[extendable-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/extendable_pydantic/) and
the odoo addon
[extendable](https://github.com/acsone/odoo-addon-extendable)
