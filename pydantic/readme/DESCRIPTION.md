This addon provides a utility method that can be used to map odoo record to a
[Pydantic model](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).

If you need to make your Pydantic models extendable at runtime, takes a look at the
python package [extendable-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/extendable_pydantic/) and
the odoo addon [extendable](https://github.com/acsone/odoo-addon-extendable)
