This addon is a technical addon used to allows the use of
[extendable](https://pypi.org/project/extendable/) classes in the implementation of your
fastapi endpoint handlers. It also allows you to use
[extendable_pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/extendable_pydantic/) models when
defining your endpoint handlers request and response models.
