This addon is a technical addon used to allows the use of
`extendable <https://pypi.org/project/extendable/>`_
classes in the implementation of your fastapi endpoint handlers. It also
allows you to use `extendable_pydantic <https://pypi.org/project/extendable_pydantic/>`_
models when defining your endpoint handlers request and response models.
