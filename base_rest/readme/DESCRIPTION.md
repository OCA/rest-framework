This addon is deprecated and not fully supported anymore on Odoo 16. Please migrate to
the FastAPI migration module. See <https://github.com/OCA/rest-framework/pull/291>.

This addon provides the basis to develop high level REST APIs for Odoo.

As Odoo becomes one of the central pieces of enterprise IT systems, it often becomes
necessary to set up specialized service interfaces, so existing systems can interact
with Odoo.

While the XML-RPC interface of Odoo comes handy in such situations, it requires a deep
understanding of Odooâ€™s internal data model. When used extensively, it creates a strong
coupling between Odoo internals and client systems, therefore increasing maintenance
costs.

Once developed, an [OpenApi](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) documentation is
generated from the source code and available via a
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) served by your odoo server at
https://my_odoo_server/api-docs.
