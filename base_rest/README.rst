This addon provides the basis to develop high level REST APIs for Odoo.

As Odoo becomes one of the central pieces of enterprise IT systems, it often
becomes necessary to set up specialized service interfaces, so existing
systems can interact with Odoo.

While the XML-RPC interface of Odoo comes handy in such situations, it
requires a deep understanding of Odoo’s internal data model. When used
extensively, it creates a strong coupling between Odoo internals and client
systems, therefore increasing maintenance costs.

Configuration
=============

If an error occurs when calling a method of a service (ie missing parameter,
..) the system returns only a general description of the problem without
details. This is done on purpose to ensure maximum opacity on implementation
details and therefore lower security issue.

This restriction can be problematic when the services are accessed by an
external system in development. To know the details of an error it is indeed
necessary to have access to the log of the server. It is not always possible
to provide this kind of access. That's why you can configure the server to run
these services in development mode.

To run the REST API in development mode you must add a new section
'**[base_rest]**' with the option '**dev_mode=True**' in the server config
file.

.. code-block:: cfg

    [base_rest]
    dev_mode=True

When the REST API runs in development mode, the original description and a
stack trace is returned in case of error. **Be careful to not use this mode
in production**.

Usage
=====

To add your own REST service you must provides at least 2 classes.

* A Component providing the business logic of your service,
* A Controller to register your service.

The business logic of your service must be implemented into a component
(``odoo.addons.component.core.Component``) that inherit from
'base.rest.service'

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo.addons.component.core import Component


    class PingService(Component):
        _inherit = 'base.rest.service'
        _name = 'ping.service'
        _usage = 'ping'
        _collection = 'my_module.services'


        # The following method are 'public' and can be called from the controller.
        def get(self, _id, message):
            return {
                'response': 'Get called with message ' + message}

        def search(self, message):
            return {
                'response': 'Search called search with message ' + message}

        def update(self, _id, message):
            return {'response': 'PUT called with message ' + message}

        # pylint:disable=method-required-super
        def create(self, **params):
            return {'response': 'POST called with message ' + params['message']}

        def delete(self, _id):
            return {'response': 'DELETE called with id %s ' % _id}

        # Validator
        def _validator_search(self):
            return {'message': {'type': 'string'}}

        # Validator
        def _validator_get(self):
            # no parameters by default
            return {}

        def _validator_update(self):
            return {'message': {'type': 'string'}}

        def _validator_create(self):
            return {'message': {'type': 'string'}}

Once your have implemented your services (ping, ...), you must tell to Odoo
how to access to these services. This process is done by implementing a
controller that inherits from  ``odoo.addons.base_rest.controllers.main.RestController``

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo.addons.base_rest.controllers import main

    class MyRestController(main.RestController):
        _root_path = '/my_services_api/'
        _collection_name = my_module.services

In your controller, _'root_path' is used to specify the root of the path to
access to your services and '_collection_name' is the name of the collection
providing the business logic for the requested service/


By inheriting from ``RestController`` the following routes will be registered
to access to your services

.. code-block:: python

    @route([
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>',
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/search',
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<int:_id>',
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<int:_id>/get'
    ], methods=['GET'], auth="user", csrf=False)
    def get(self, _service_name, _id=None, **params):
        method_name = 'get' if _id else 'search'
        return self._process_method(_service_name, method_name, _id, params)

    @route([
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>',
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<string:method_name>',
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<int:_id>',
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<int:_id>/<string:method_name>'
    ], methods=['POST'], auth="user", csrf=False)
    def modify(self, _service_name, _id=None, method_name=None, **params):
        if not method_name:
            method_name = 'update' if _id else 'create'
        if method_name == 'get':
            _logger.error("HTTP POST with method name 'get' is not allowed. "
                          "(service name: %s)", _service_name)
            raise BadRequest()
        return self._process_method(_service_name, method_name, _id, params)

    @route([
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<int:_id>',
    ], methods=['PUT'], auth="user", csrf=False)
    def update(self, _service_name, _id, **params):
        return self._process_method(_service_name, 'update', _id, params)

    @route([
        ROOT_PATH + '<string:_service_name>/<int:_id>',
    ], methods=['DELETE'], auth="user", csrf=False)
    def delete(self, _service_name, _id):
        return self._process_method(_service_name, 'delete', _id)


The HTTP GET 'http://my_odoo/my_services_api/ping' will be dispatched to the
method ``PingService.search``
